**Buying tools for developers**

App sec should buy tools for developers. This is a great opportunity for the application security team to generate goodwill and positive working relationships with their developers. If the app sec team is able to actually find the budget for tools, it will help developers be more productive.

Two great examples would be whether be is for java script developers, n crunch, is for .net development you always kind of find in organizations teams where for some reason management hasn't seen as a priority tool for developers.

It's a good opportunity for security teams to buy those tools and give them to developers at will, but also as a sign of, "Hey, we need you to write more tests and when you're able to write more tests, we can write our abuse cases". So this is actually more a security tool than a development tool.

That being said, it of course is also a development tool purely in terms of what we're doing. We are improving the ability for that team to write better tests and we're also creating good relationships for the developers.

The concept of making developers more productive, I think, is something that has to really permeate everything that the application secures. One of the key objectives of the app sec team is to make their firm more productive. With that said, everything we can do to make them better is fair game.

Now the reality is that sometimes we do need to ask them to do some sins for security. For example, some of the SSL security stuff is kind of negative and developers don't really need it. But that's a good example of how, if we have enough goodwill and balance in the bank, we'll be able to work with karma points and we can wait to actually push those changes.

If we are always seen as the source of work and it seems like we're not adding value, but instead, just making their lives more complicated, they aren't going to do it. In fact, a really good comment I heard from some developers is that they are "neutral" -- they view all requests from all parts of the business as relatively important, but then they focus on the ones that they get rewarded most for or in which they see the most value. This is the very reason why we need to put app security in the area of adding value to developers and the business.
